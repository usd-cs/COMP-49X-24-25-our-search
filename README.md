## About

The Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) at USD launched the Student Engagement and Access Research Community Hub (SEARCH) to connect students with faculty conducting research. This is an app that streamlines the current manual data management process, making it easier for students and faculty to collaborate and receive real-time updates on matching research interests.

## Prerequisites

* be a valid USD student or faculty member (@sandiego.edu)

## Installation - DEVELOPMENT MODE

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

  - Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory. 
    
    
    docker compose up
  
- Wait for the images to build and the containers to start. This effectively sets up the MySQL database and installs dependencies, builds, and runs the frontend and the backend.
